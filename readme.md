## Description
Ready Up is the premier LFG esque application for gamers. Ready Up will allow gamers a way to sync up with one another on todays hottest games. 

## Motivation
Gamers today don't always want to rely on in game matchmaking and instead want ways to meet other gamers that have their similar skill or rank. Ready Up sets out to offer gamers a way to do just that by haveing them create an account and join a queue of the games offered and then give them the option to join others seeking the same. 

## Results
Once gamers create an account on Ready Up, they can then join a queue of the available games to be matched with. They can also switch between queues, edit their profile or visit the contact page to view various Ready Up social pages or send an email.

## Team Efforts
In managing this project we delegated out who would managed the repo, worked together on merges but also created a KanBan board with user stories and each developer would pull the story they wanted to work on.
